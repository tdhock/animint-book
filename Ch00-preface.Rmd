# Welcome to the animint2 manual web site!

This manual explains how to design and create interactive data
visualizations using the R package `animint2`. The chapters of this
manual are organized as follows.

## The animint2 extensions to the grammar of graphics {#animint}

The first seven chapters should be read sequentially, since they give
a step by step guide to interactive data visualization using
animint2.

[Chapter 1](Ch01-motivation.html) gives an overview of data analysis
and visualization. It provides motivation and a theoretical foundation
for the other chapters, and should be especially useful for readers
who are completely new to data analysis. It introduces the method of
data visualization prototyping using sketches, without introducing R
code.

Starting with [chapter 2](Ch02-ggplot2.html), we will show how plot
sketches can be translated into R code. Chapter 2 explains the basics
of plotting using ggplots and animint2, and should be most useful for
readers who have never used ggplot2. It explains how standard ggplots
can be rendered on web pages using animint2.

[Chapter 3](Ch03-showSelected.html) introduces showSelected, one of
the two main keywords that animint2 introduces for interactive data
visualization design. Chapter 3 begins by explaining selection
variables, which provide the mechanism of interaction in
animint2. Chapter 3 then explains how the showSelected keyword makes it
possible to plot data subsets. Chapter 3 also explains how to use
smooth transitions and animation.

[Chapter 4](Ch04-clickSelects.html) introduces clickSelects, the other
main keyword that animint2 introduces for interactive data
visualization design. The clickSelects keyword makes it possible for
the user to change a selection variable by directly clicking on a plot
element.

[Chapter 5](Ch05-sharing.html) explains several different ways to
share your interactive data visualizations on the web.

[Chapter 6](Ch06-other.html) covers some other features of animint2,
including how to specify hyperlinks, tooltips, data-driven selector
variable names.

[Chapter 7](Ch07-limitations.html) covers the limitations of the
current implementation of the animint2 R package, and explains
workarounds for some common issues. It also includes some ideas for
improvements, for those who would like to contribute to animint2.

## Examples {#examples}

The remaining chapters can be read in any order, since each
chapter explains how to make data visualizations for a particular data
set. 

[Chapter 8](Ch08-WorldBank-facets.html) explains how to create a multi-panel interactive World Bank
data visualization.

[Chapter 9](Ch09-Montreal-bikes.html) shows a visualization of data from cyclists in Montreal.

[Chapter 10](Ch10-nearest-neighbors.html) explains how to create an
interactive re-design of the nearest neighbors data visualization from
the Elements of Statistical Learning book by Hastie et al.

[Chapter 11](Ch11-lasso.html) shows a data visualization that explains the Lasso, a
machine learning model for regularized regression.

[Chapter 12](Ch12-SVM.html) shows a data visualization that explains support vector
machines (SVM), a machine learning model for binary classification.

[Chapter 13](Ch13-poisson-regression.html) explains how to create an
interactive visualization that explains the Poisson regression model.

[Chapter 14](Ch14-PeakSegJoint.html) shows an example of how to create
data-driven selectors using named clickSelects/showSelects in an
interactive visualization of a peak detection model.

[Chapter 15](Ch15-Newton.html) explains how to create an interactive
visualization of the Newton root-finding algorithm.

[Chapter 16](Ch16-change-point.html) explains how to create an interactive
visualization of an optimal changepoint detection model.

[Chapter 17](Ch17-k-means-clustering.html) explains how to create an
interactive visualization of the k-means clustering algorithm.

[Chapter 18](Ch18-neural-networks.html) explains how to create an
interactive visualization of the gradient descent algorithm for
learning neural network weight matrices.

## Appendix {#appendix}

[The appendix](Ch99-appendix.html) contains detailed explanations of
several R code idioms that are used throughout this manual.
